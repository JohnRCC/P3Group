# P3 Theory Group Projects 2015 - Group 4

------------

## To do list:

  - Figure out bug creting asymmetries in numerical scheme (Seen in system A)

1. **Conditionals** (for system A vs numerical run)

  - Check for arguments being equal to the amount required.
      Might be a hassle thoug if we want to add more input args.
      so good idea to give that a think beforehand.

2. **Mesh test** 

  -  Refine test for matrix values to be meshed
  
  - Apply meshing to the numeric solution for System A 
      - Change parameters passed to analytic function

3. **Analysis**
  
  - Error
    - What is to be analysed?
  
  - Program efectiveness
      - Runtime
      - Iterations 
      - Test for different: relaxation methods, difference methods, etc.

4. Tidy up in main (?)

## To ask Lars next Tuesday:

  1. Software demonstration
