  \noindent\textbf{This is for obtaining the electric potential in a generic two-dimensional electrostatics system}

  \vspace{5mm}

	A bitmap (pixelated drawing) describing the components of the system is passed to the program. Each pixel is then 
	 mapped to a matrix holding values between 0 and 1, to represent the initial system. Values related to components
	 (conductors or charges) are static and the rest of space will vary as the prgram runs.\\
	A numerical algorithm, alg.() is run, "propagating" the field in the matrix, until the change in all values, is 
	 considered sufficiently small. The small change is determined by a user-defined percentage value. \\
	The matrix had thus a second layer; upon each iteration, the new values are cast to the other layer of the 
	 matrix and recast in the next instance of the application of the algorithm. 
	When the system has settled, regions where discontinuities might be present, by, for example, (NORMALISED?)
	 steep gradients, are treated, pixelwise, in a finer grid usng the same algorithm as above. (LINEARISATION?)
	After the scheme is finished, the resulting matrix is then plotted using a plotting package where  a "heat-map" 
	 functionality is used to depict the potential. For the fieldlines, some further calculation is requred: the 
	 gradient between each pixel is calculated and used to plot the electric field, as requred by equation Eq.().
